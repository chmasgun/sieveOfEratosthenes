# sieveOfEratosthenes
Prime number generator using Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. It is an iterative method and efficient in time, however requires big 
spaces to hold primeness data of processed numbers. It calculates 500.000th prime number in approximately 5 seconds, however its space
requirement is considerably high. Some other method with memoization technique would solve this specific issue.
